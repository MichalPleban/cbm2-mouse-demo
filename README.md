# CBM-II serial mouse demo

This program serves as a demo for connecting a Microsoft serial mouse
to a CBM-II computer via the serial port.

To run the demo, load and run the MOUSE.PRG program from BASIC.

Moving the mouse moves the cursor around the screen. Left mouse button
sets a character at the current positon, and right mouse button
clears it.
